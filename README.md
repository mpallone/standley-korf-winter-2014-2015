# standley-korf-winter-2014-2015
Implementation of Standley and Korf's algorithms for the sake of becoming more familiar with them. 

Note that this code is not intended to be well designed or efficient. It's only purpose in life is to help me learn Standley and Korf's OD+ID algorithms over
winter break.
